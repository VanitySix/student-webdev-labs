## Reflection Document

### HTML

I was able to complete the excericises by myself but I used the video to guide me. I dont see why I would not watch them all for futurre excercises. I liked the videos and the excercieses because they were simple and easy to follow. I was able to get more insight by your thought process viewing the videos on when and where we should use things.

I think the cat and dog picture links could have been explained a little bit more. Like why is the link able to withhold picture value sizes like "https://placecats.com/200/150" and what links have this property.

### Accessibility/form

This was simple to recreate for me. It would have been helpful had I not known how to do a form. Forms are very important for most websites. An explanation on how to grrab the userss data would be nice. If not, maybe tell us when we will in the future and give us a preview. This form format is very standard, maybe an excercise where we do another form would have been good.

### css-grid

The guide you provided for this excercise was very important this time around. I initially had a lot of problems with formatting because the values were not correct or sufficient. I like the part where Im able to munipulate and make some sections take more space than others. I think another excercise where there is a gap in different places of the container could be beneficial.

### flexbox

As usual I used the videos to guide me. It was pretty intuitive and easy to use. The excercises of making a different type of grid was useful as it could prepare me for situations in the future where I need to format things differently. Flex container 5 is irregular and is impractical but it shows how I can munipulate the sections. This could be very useful in the future. I think nothing could have been explained better.

### css-grid

I definitely needed extra help with this one. Grids and formmating in web dev made me realize that it is a lot more difficult thhan I initially imagagined. The videos helped me decide on the numerical values that were needed for the assignment. The explanations are fine to me.

### bootstrap

The videos did guide me through. This was a good excercise because it shows us how to use frameworks. I think an excercise showing different grid formats would be good beucase I think the format in the excercises are not practical. This section had a lecture on bootstrap and frameworks so I am happy with the explanations given for this excercise.

### javascript

I was able to complete the excercises but I also did use the videos to help guide me as always. I have programmed in javascript before for android development but have never heard or seen arrow functions. It seems to be the default for ES6 though. I needed the most help with fetching and setting up the data for the webpage. I think all these excercises are enough for the given time we have in this class.

### jquery

I did watch the videos to help me through the excercises. The excercises are very useful because it is the only way we know how to get the users data so far. The ajax excercise was a bit confusing espicially with the fetch data function. Not only is it dense in code but it also has a lot of nesting. The videos were not good enough for me to unstand everything but I do understand the overall purpose of the block of code.
