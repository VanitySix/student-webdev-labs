I was able to complete the excericises by myself but I used the video to match the solution perfectly. I liked the videos and the excercieses because they were simple and eeasy to follow. I was able to get more insight by your thought process viewing the videos on when and where we should use things.

I think the cat and dog picture links could have been explained a little bit more. Like why is the link able to withhold picture value sizes like "https://placecats.com/200/150" and what links have this property.

These excercises are sufficient for the beginning assignment.
